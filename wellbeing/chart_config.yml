    While the growth and size of GDP are oft-cited measures of the nation’s economic health, they are not measures of economic well-being. A large and growing GDP may simply reflect a large and growing population. GDP per capita standardizes for population and is often used as a proxy for a nation's standard of living.
    
    Real—inflation-adjusted—GDP per capita has grown more slowly than real GDP, increasing 2.5 percent per year on average between 1947 and 1973, compared with 4.0 percent for real GDP. Over the last two business cycles, between 2007 and 2022, growth slowed with real GDP per capita increasing at 1.1 percent per year and real GDP growing at 1.8 percent per year.

    Real GDP per capita and real median personal income provide two different perspectives on economic growth. 
    
    Real GDP per capita spreads total production across the entire population equally.
    
    Alternatively, real median equivalized personal income—that is, adjusted for household size—provides an inflation-adjusted measure of total income received by the “middle” income household, whose income is below 50 percent of households and above the other 50 percent of households.
    
    Real median personal income is a more appropriate gauge of how the U.S. economic pie is distributed because it focuses on how income accrues to households rather than on GDP, which is a measure of production.
    
    For 2007–2021, real median equivalized personal income grew 1.8 percent per year, higher than the growth of 1.1 percent per year in real GDP per capita. The main driver of the difference in growth between the two measures was personal current transfer receipts, which impact personal income but not GDP. These receipts include benefits from programs like social security, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance.

    One driver of the changing distribution of income is the movement in the share of labor income relative to capital income. "Capital income" refers to income arising from the use of fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. After reaching 63 percent in 1970, labor's share of income has generally declined, and in 2022 stood at 56.1 percent. Capital's share of income increased from 37 percent in 1970 to 43.9 percent in 2022.

    Another key measure of the economic well-being of a nation is its wealth. Wealth increases economic welfare by supplementing income for large purchases, unemployment, emergencies, retirement, education, and bequests to heirs.
    
    Since 1960, household wealth—measured by net worth (that is, household assets less liabilities)—has risen every year except for in 2002 after the dotcom bust, in 2008 during the Great Recession, and in 2022 coming out of the coronavirus pandemic.
    
    In addition, the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income (DPI) indicates whether trends in saving and wealth are in line with movements in income. During the post-WWII era, net worth of households as a percentage of DPI has risen, with net worth around eight times larger than DPI in 2022.

    Economists since Adam Smith have been concerned with sustaining a level of economic growth that would provide for a rising standard of living for a growing population. In the national accounts, sustainable growth is measured by net domestic product (NDP), which is equal to GDP less depreciation, that is, what is left over for consumption after deducting the amount necessary to replace the capital used up in that production.
    
    Over the last few decades, NDP has grown more slowly than GDP. From 1973 to 2022, real NDP grew at 2.4 percent per year on average, compared with 2.6 percent for real GDP. This is the result of gross investment spending (a component of GDP) growing more slowly than depreciation. This slowing of investment spending has reduced the net investment available for activities that produce economic growth and that lead to a rise in productivity and standards of living.

    Growth in GDP is essential to economic well-being.
    
    Over time, there has been a slowdown in all three of the sources of economic growth—labor and capital inputs and multifactor productivity (real GDP per unit of output)—which has contributed to the declining rate of long-term growth.
    
    The slowdown in labor input is accounted for by demographic factors such as the aging and retirement of the population. The slowdown in capital services reflects a slowdown in net investment (and saving). The slowdown in multifactor productivity is much debated and reflects many factors, including the pace of technological change.

    International trade is an important factor in economic growth. By allowing for specialization across nations and raising productivity, trade yields higher growth and standards of living.
    
    Between 1947 and 2022, overall U.S. trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP grew from about 10.5 percent to about 27 percent. The increased international trade—along with higher quality economic data and better-informed policies and institutions—contributed to an unprecedented period of growth in standards of living in the United States and other developed economies. Since 1947, real GDP per capita more than quadrupled in the United States.
    
    Until the mid-1970s, the United States had an international trade balance that was usually in surplus. Over time, the U.S. trade balance moved to persistent trade deficits (with deficits on goods more than offsetting surpluses in services). These trade deficits were the result of domestic spending that exceeded domestic production, or its mirror image, low national saving that reflects the higher domestic spending. The lower investment that often accompanies lower saving may slow growth in productivity, the economy, and standards of living, thereby offsetting some of the positive contributions of international trade to economic growth.

      The debt service to exports ratio is calculated as net investment
      income payments to the rest of the world (ROW) divided by exports. The
      debt service to income ratio is calculated as net investment income
      payments to ROW divided by gross domestic income. The debt to asset
      ratio is calculated as net U.S. liabilities to ROW divided by U.S.
      household assets.

    One indicator of the long-term impact of U.S. trade deficits is the net amount the nation pays in external debt service, dividends, reinvested earnings, and other investment income to foreign investors relative to its exports. While the "debt service to exports ratio" generally increased from the mid-1970s through the late-1990s and trended downward thereafter, it has been consistently negative, meaning that the United States receives more in foreign investment income than it pays to foreign residents.
    
    Because the U.S. dollar is an international currency, the United States' ability to service foreign debt is not constrained by the supply of currency earned through exports but by its income. Comparing net investment income payments to gross domestic income, shows that the "debt service to income ratio" has remained relatively stable over time.
    
    Another key measure is the ratio of U.S. net liabilities to the rest of the world compared with U.S. household assets. The "international debt to asset ratio" has grown since the 1980s, with international debt equal to around 9.5 percent of U.S. assets in 2022.
    
    Currently, U.S. receipts from overseas investments exceed payments for foreign investments in the United States, resulting in a surplus on international investment income even though the United States has outstanding net liabilities to the rest of the world. The rates of return earned by U.S. residents on assets abroad exceed the rates of return on foreign-held assets in the United States by a large enough amount to offset U.S. debt payments to the rest of the world.

  narrative: |-
    The movement of U.S. jobs abroad by U.S. companies often is seen as a threat to the long-term growth of the U.S. economy and its ability to produce high-paying domestic jobs. A look at the data shows that most of U.S. multinational companies' employment remains in the United States. For example, in 2020, about 67 percent of U.S. multinationals' employment was in the United States.
    
    The share of foreign employment has risen as large and emerging economies like India and China have expanded their share of world income. However, most employment remains in high- and middle-income countries rather than low-income countries. Growth in foreign employment has been concentrated in middle-income countries.
    
    In addition, BEA data on U.S.-owned foreign companies show that most overseas subsidiaries sell their goods and services in the countries where they are located or to other foreign countries. In 2020, only 13 percent of U.S. foreign subsidiaries' sales were to the United States. These trends suggest that the location of foreign production is more for access to large and growing markets than for low-cost labor.

    There are several key indicators used to assess the economic effects of debt burdens. This includes borrowers' ability to service their debt and how borrowing in each period compares with income.
    
    For the federal government, the ability to service debt is measured by the "federal debt service ratio," calculated as federal interest payments divided by gross national income (GNI). Borrowing compared with income is measured using the "federal net borrowing to income ratio," calculated as federal total expenditures less federal total receipts divided by national income.
    
    The federal debt service ratio has remained relatively flat over the last few decades. The federal net borrowing to income ratio has been much more volatile, peaking in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic.

    Net investment—gross investment less depreciation—is often called sustainable investment. A significant share of gross investment in plant, equipment, and IT goes toward replacing capital that wears out (that is, depreciation). Net investment increases the nation's production capabilities.
    
    Net saving represents the amount of net income that is available to finance net investment; however, net investment can also be financed by borrowing from the rest of the world.
    
    During the post-WWII era, net investment and net saving have been trending down (with the related drags on productivity, growth, and standards of living). The downward trend in net investment has slowed growth in U.S. capital stock and capital services, accounting for a large share of the decline in trend GDP growth (see "Trends in Real Economic Growth" above).
    
    The gap between the net investment rate and the net saving rate has widened over the last 35 years, with the net saving rate turning negative in 2008 during the Great Recession for the first time since the Great Depression.
